# JS-Counter
Start2Impact - Javascript basic guide project

## How it works

 1. Set a offset value in the input field 
 2. Unfocus input field
 3. Start counting
 4. When you finish counting, click on the reset button

*Note: The input field verifies that input value is a number. Otherwise, input value will be reset to '0' as default value.*
